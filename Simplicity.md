Simplicity:

It is extremely important to be close to ground reality as much as possible. We have to implement a new capability in simplest possible way. We do not have to develop feature which we do not need at this very moment. We also ought to have more communication which will help get clear picture of what needs to be done.

Week 1:

Implementing the game is an unexplored territory for the team. After exploring the ambitious ideas, we did a feasibility check of time and resources and finalized to make the Aladdin Game. The game has to have three levels of the game, which is the long-term plan. Currently, we have explored and decided to go ahead with making the first level of the game, so that we have a working prototype at the earliest with us. Next, depending on the bandwidth of resources, we will go ahead with adding features and levels for the game.

Week 2:

Everyone started to pour on ideas of directly developing the application. But firstly we have to be precise with requirements so that we do not over-do things and complicate it. We just need to focus on first developing user stories clearly so as to go to next step of developing UML diagrams.


Week 3:

After communicating within team and with Professor, it became clear that we cannot have a generalized user story. Rather, we need to have different user stories for each thing individually like actor and hurdle. Also we understood there is no need to parallel develop the protocol, while not being clear with user story. So I have asked team to focus on development of user stories, and learning Greenfoot over directly starting to make application.

Week 4:

There were ideas floating as to how different and descriptive user stories can be. We have sticked to simple format for user stories with fulfilling the three basic parameters: " ' As a <user>', 'I want to <> ','so that <> '" format.for each object involved in the user stories.

Week 5:

We decided on writing indivaidual user story for all objects in order to make it more simple to understand role of each actor in project. To make coding more easy, team decided to know more about design patterns to make developement more simple.
